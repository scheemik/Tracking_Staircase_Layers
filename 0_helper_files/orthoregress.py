	using the same interface as the standard scipy.stats.linregress function.
	
	Arguments:
	x: x data
	y: y data
	
	Returns:
	# [m, c, nan, nan, nan]
	[m, c, sd_m, sd_c]
	
	Uses standard ordinary least squares to estimate the starting parameters
	then uses the scipy.odr interface to the ODRPACK Fortran code to do the
	orthogonal distance calculations.
