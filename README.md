## Summary

This repository contains the code used by the above study to apply the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) clustering algorithm to data from Ice Tethered Profilers. This is a follow-up to the study by Mikhail Schee, Erica Rosenblum, Jonathan M. Lilly, and Nicolas Grisouard (2024) "Unsupervised Clustering Identifies Thermohaline Staircases in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean," Environmental Data Science, 3:e13, 1-19, doi:10.1017/eds.2024.13, the code for which can be found at https://github.com/scheemik/Staircase_Clustering_Detection_Algorithm and serves as a basis for his project.

A detailed explanation of how the code was used to make each plot in the study can be found in the accompanying Jupyter notebook `Create_Figures.ipynb`.
