## Summary

This repository contains the code used by the above study to apply the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) clustering algorithm to data from Ice Tethered Profilers.

A detailed explanation of how the code was used to make each plot in the study can be found in the accompanying Jupyter notebook `Create_Figures.ipynb`.

## Acknowledgements

The Ice-Tethered Profiler data were collected and made available by the Ice-Tethered Profiler Program (Toole et al., 2011; Krishfield et al., 2008) based at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution https://www2.whoi.edu/site/itp/

This repository includes the [orthoregress code](https://gist.github.com/robintw/d94eb527c44966fbc8b9) from [Robin Wilson](https://blog.rtwilson.com/orthogonal-distance-regression-in-python/).
